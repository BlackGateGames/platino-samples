BunnyMark

A fun 2D sprite benchmark sample app, based on [Iain Lobb's original](http://blog.iainlobb.com/2010/11/display-list-vs-blitting-results.html).

The demo starts with 10 bouncing bunnies, with more bunnies being added on every screen tap. Monitor the app's frames-per-second (FPS) in realtime as bunnies invade your device!
